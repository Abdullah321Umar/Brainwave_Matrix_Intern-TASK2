## 🐦 Task 2 | Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis 💬
Welcome to the Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis Project! 
This project focuses on analyzing customer opinions shared on Twitter regarding major US airlines. ✈️ By studying text data, sentiments, and trends, we aim to understand customer satisfaction levels, identify common issues, and uncover insights that can guide airline service improvements.
